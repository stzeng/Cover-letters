This cover letter is for form I-864EZ Affidavit of Support and its supplemental material.  I, Stanley Tzeng, am writing to prove that I meet the minimum poverty requirements and can support my wife Hsiao-Chi Tzeng should she become a permanent resident here in the United States.  In this package you will find:
\begin{itemize}
\item One completed form I-864EZ filled and signed by me.
\item Two 2011 W-2 forms by the University of California, Davis and Intel Corporation.  My income is the sum of these two values.
\item One signed letter by my advisor John Owens explaining my funding as a PhD student.
\item Three copies of my most recent I-1040 forms.  They are for the years 2010, 2009, 2008.  

\end{itemize}

Should there be any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us via e-mail stzeng@ucdavis.edu or by phone at 650-996-9847.  Thank you once again and we look forward to hearing from you soon.
